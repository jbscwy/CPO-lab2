192050208 Jia Yuebin

## variant description:

eDSL for finite state machine (Mealy).

## synopsis:

Display as a state graph (GraphViz dots) or table (ASCII).

Provide a complex example, such as the controller of an elevator, a traffic light at an intersection, and so on.After modification, delete the example of the traffic light at the intersection, the main example is the controller of the elevator

## contribution summary for each group member

### To work together:

Complete the FSM class together
### Personal work：
Mu Yuanai complete the elevator example and the corresponding tests.
Jia Yuebin complete the trafficSignal example and the corresponding tests（deleted）

 - elevator example:
 According to the input of different elevator state value, output different actions
 
 - the elevator example:(deleted)
 Through the input signal light different state, output vehicle action

## conclusion:

According to the elevator example, different actions are performed by entering different values through the state machine.Understand the basic purpose of a finite state machine: to "run" in response to a series of events
