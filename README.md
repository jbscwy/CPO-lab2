variant description:
eDSL for finite state machine (Mealy).

synopsis:
Visualization as a state diagram (GraphViz DOT) or table (ASCII).
Provide complex an example like a controller for an elevator, crossroad with a traffic light, etc

contribution summary for each group member
Mu Yuanai complete the elevator example
Jia Yuebin complete the trafficSignal example

elevator example:According to the input of different elevator state value, output different actions
trafficSignal example:It can output different actions according to the input status value of different semaphore

trafficSignal/FSM.py:
Finite state machine class

trafficSignal/test.py:
unit testing

trafficSignal/trafficSignal.py:
The use of finite state machines in the traffic light example






conclusion:According to two examples, different states can be returned according to different values entered.To understand the basic purpose of a finite state machine: to "run" in response to a series of events
